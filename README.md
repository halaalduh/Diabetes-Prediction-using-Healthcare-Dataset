# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Healthcare-Dataset  

## Project Description  
This project uses the **Healthcare Diabetes Dataset** from Kaggle to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical attributes such as age, glucose level, BMI, insulin, and other health indicators.  

The main objectives are:  
- **Classification**: identifying patients at risk of diabetes (diabetic vs. non-diabetic).  
- **Clustering**: grouping patients with similar health profiles to discover hidden patterns and risk factors.  

## Project Motivation  
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and an increasing health concern. Early prediction can significantly reduce complications and improve patients’ quality of life. By applying **machine learning classification and clustering techniques** to this dataset, we aim to:  
- Provide useful insights for healthcare professionals.  
- Support preventive healthcare and awareness.  
- Demonstrate how AI can contribute to solving real-world medical problems.
