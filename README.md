# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Healthcare-Dataset


# Project Description
This project uses the Healthcare Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical attributes such as age, glucose level, BMI, insulin, and other health indicators. The main objective is classification: identifying patients at risk of diabetes.

# Project Motivation
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and an increasing health concern. Early prediction can significantly reduce complications and improve patients’ quality of life. By applying machine learning classification techniques to this dataset, we aim to:
	•	Provide useful insights for healthcare professionals.
	•	Support preventive healthcare and awareness.
	•	Demonstrate how AI can contribute to solving real-world medical problems.
